                            Founded in 2025 by a group of concerned citizens who noticed that democracy started declining right around 1920. What happened in 1920, you ask? The 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote, and coincidentally, that's when everything started going downhill.

                            Our organization is dedicated to the revolutionary idea that sometimes, just sometimes, women need to shut up and let the menfolk handle the important decisions. We're not saying women should never speak - they can still discuss recipes, child-rearing, and which curtains match the sofa.
                        </p>

                            Through extensive research, we've concluded that 73.2% of America's problems could be solved if women would just shut up more often during political discussions.
